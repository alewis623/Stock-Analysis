# Stock-Analysis
## Analysis on VBA Deliverable 1
  The purpose of this analysis is to compare the effectiveness of using the orginal VBA script in contrast with the refractored VBA script.
  Speed, the code used, and the process to produce the code will be examined. 
### Speed 
--
The refractored script produced the following results, 2017 results were delivered in .863 seconds.

  The refractored script for 2018 delivered the results in .125 seconds.

  This was an increase from the class work that resulted in 1.640625 for 2017 and 1.644531 for 2018.

### Coding
--
-The orginal script coding was easier on multiple issues and data to reflect how to build the code was methodical. The course work did a good job of explaining the process and how to develop the final results. This sequential step by step process was possible to follow.

-The refractoring challenge reinforced the concepts developed during the course work. This was an extremely difficult challenge for me and took considerable hours including reaching out to TA's, class mates, office hours, online research and reaching out to Ask BCS. One of the key errors were due to the missplaced setting of the nested if in section3(d). Mo did an excellent job of helping me through this issue. Additionally on the 2nd assignment submission, an entire section of code was missing making the code inoperable. This issue is now resolved. 
The final code can be viewed below:


 ### Code Development Process
 --
 Of course the work on canvas helped develop the orginal code. The refractoring was a very difficult challenge for me and took considerable hours including reaching out to TA's(thank you to Nick and Mo), class mates, office hours, online research (https://stackoverflow.com/, https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/vba/Language/Concepts/Getting-Started/understanding-visual-basic-syntax and https://excelchamps.com/vba/subscript-out-of-range-error-9/ as online examples. I also reached out out to Ask BCS. The final error was due to the missplaced ending of an nested if. 
### Conclusion
--
While the results of refractoring were considerably quicker approximately 1 second for each years analysis. The amount of effort that was created by redoing the code utimately lead me to consider in this case that it was not necessary to change to refractoring. If the file was considerably larger and the lessons drawn from the troubleshooting were applied it might be advantageous to use this method on future larger projects.
